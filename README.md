# Searching Algorithms
C++ Sequential and Binary Search

This program implements the binary search algorithm in two functions: an iterative one and a recursive one.

This program implements searching an integer array for one value linearly. Two functions exist to do this: an iterative one and a recursive one.
Another function in this program is one that gets the highest value in an array linearly

# IntegerBucketSort
C++ Bucket Sort Program for Integers

This program includes the bucketsort algorithm for integers. It uses the bucketsort function to sort a vector of 100 random values.
The bucketsort algorithm for integers increments a vector with a size equal to the range of the values being sorted
We then extract the values in sorted order by looking at all the nonzero values in the array we incremented

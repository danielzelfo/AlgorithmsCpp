# QuickSelect
C++ Program for the QuickSelect Algorithm

This program includes a function that find the kth smallest element using a variation of the randomized quicksort algorithm
This algorithm can find the the kth smallest element in a linear worst case running time
This is done by using the prune-and search design pattern which gets rid of the portion of the data being observed in each recusive call based on the value of k
